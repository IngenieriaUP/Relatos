# A Text Analysis App

This platform objective is to deliver in a easy-to-use interface classical NLP techniques such as:

1. Dependency Parsing
2. Entity Recognition
3. Text Summarization

And so on...

We hope to add more features and improve the platform usability by using a multidisciplinary approach, interviewing data analysis and literature analysis experts.
